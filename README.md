Overview of project plan:<p>
  Javascript to-do list:
  - Create variables which reference DOM elements
  - Desdign function for event listener to save input in local storage
  - Input must be retained on the page once it saved, even if a user navigates away from the page
  - Design function for applying appropriate 'time' class to each block 
  - Compare attribute of each block with current time using Day.js and add/remove classes accordingly
  - Add Day.js to header to create dynamic date/time display

  HTML to-do list:
  - Complete daily schedule blocks (9a-5p)
  - Change class and/or id info to account for dynamic rendering of 'past', 'present', and 'future'
    claseses
  
  CSS to-do list:

  - Utilize Bootstrap for inline formatting 

# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
